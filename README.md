Huffman.py 
The class HuffmanTree is a basic binary tree without parenting.

The code is constructed around the functions present in the code and the naming of these functions is not mine.
Howewever the implementation of these are mine to claim.

bytestream.py
Code re-used not written by me.

LISCENCE.txt 
work with the tests 

tests.py 
Not writting by me either but by the teachers/helpers of the university 
assure the good behavior of the code in Huffman tree
